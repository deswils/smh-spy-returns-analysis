### SMH VS SPY RETURNS: JAN 1, 2026 to FEB 24, 2026 ###

# Total SMH returns:       +10.60%
# Daily average SMH:       +0.3154%

# Total SPY returns:       -0.11%
# Daily average SPY:       -0.0005%

# Correlation (SMH vs SPY): 74.98%

## Key Findings ##

# Performance Gap #
# SMH outpaced SPY by ~10.71 percentage points over ~8 weeks.
# This suggests semiconductors significantly outperformed the broader market to start 2026.

# SPY's Flat Return #
# SPY was essentially flat at -0.11%, meaning SMH's outperformance was not driven by a rising market.
# SMH gained strongly against a stagnant broader market.

# Correlation of Returns #
# A 74.98% correlation indicates SMH largely moved in the same direction as SPY on a daily basis.
# However, SMH accumulated meaningfully higher returns over time, suggesting sector-specific tailwinds
# beyond general market sentiment — likely driven by continued semiconductor and AI-related demand.

# Risk Considerations #
# SMH is a concentrated sector ETF, while SPY is diversified across ~500 companies.
# SMH's outperformance may partly reflect sector rotation into semiconductors,
# but concentration risk means this dynamic can reverse quickly.

# Conclusion #
# SMH meaningfully outperformed SPY over this period, but the two were not independent —
# a 74.98% correlation shows SMH still tracked broader market movements day-to-day.
# The outperformance appears driven by semiconductor-specific tailwinds on top of general market exposure.

# Caveat #
# This analysis covers only ~8 weeks of data. Short windows can reflect temporary momentum
# or sector rotation rather than a durable structural trend. Longer-term data would be needed
# to draw stronger conclusions.
