# SMH vs SPY Returns Analysis
**Jan 1, 2026 to Feb 23, 2026**

## Results

| Metric | SMH | SPY |
|---|---|---|
| Total Return | +10.60% | -0.11% |
| Avg Daily Return | +0.3154% | -0.0005% |

**Correlation (SMH vs SPY): 74.98%**

## Key Findings

### Performance Gap
SMH outpaced SPY by ~10.71 percentage points over ~8 weeks, suggesting semiconductors significantly outperformed the broader market to start 2026.

### SPY's Flat Return
SPY was essentially flat at -0.11%, meaning SMH's outperformance was not driven by a rising market — SMH gained strongly against a stagnant broader market.

### Correlation of Returns
A 74.98% correlation indicates SMH largely moved in the same direction as SPY on a daily basis. However, SMH accumulated meaningfully higher returns over time, suggesting sector-specific tailwinds beyond general market sentiment — likely driven by continued semiconductor and AI-related demand.

### Risk Considerations
SMH is a concentrated sector ETF, while SPY is diversified across ~500 companies. SMH's outperformance may partly reflect sector rotation into semiconductors, but concentration risk means this dynamic can reverse quickly.

## Conclusion
SMH meaningfully outperformed SPY over this period, but the two were not independent — a 74.98% correlation shows SMH still tracked broader market movements day-to-day. The outperformance appears driven by semiconductor-specific tailwinds on top of general market exposure.

## Caveat
This analysis covers only ~8 weeks of data. Short windows can reflect temporary momentum or sector rotation rather than a durable structural trend. Longer-term data would be needed to draw stronger conclusions.
